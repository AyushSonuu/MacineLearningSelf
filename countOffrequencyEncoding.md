# Markdown Notes: Count of Frequency Encoding for Handling High Cardinality Categories

## Introduction:

In this tut, we'll explore a technique called "Count of Frequency Encoding" to handle category features with many unique values (also known as high cardinality).

## The Problem with One-hot Encoding:

* One-hot encoding creates a new column for each unique category, leading to a significant increase in the number of features, which can cause:
  * Curse of dimensionality
  * Overfitting
  * Increased computational cost

## Count of Frequency Encoding:

* Count of frequency encoding replaces each category with the number of times it appears in the dataset.

## Advantages:

* Simple to implement
* No need for additional feature dimensions, avoiding the curse of dimensionality

## Disadvantages:

* May not be effective for all datasets
* Can lead to loss of information if categories with the same count exist
* Adds arbitrary weights to different labels

## Example:

* We apply count of frequency encoding to the `x2` feature in the `more_students_ben` dataset.
* The result is that each category in `x2` is replaced with its count in the dataset.

## Conclusion:

* Count of frequency encoding is a useful technique for handling high cardinality category features.
* However, it may not be suitable for all datasets and can have some limitations.
* It's important to explore different encoding techniques to find the one that works best for your specific dataset.
