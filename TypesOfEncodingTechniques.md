# Markdown Notes on Encoding Techniques for Categorical Variables

---
**Encoding Techniques:**

* **Types of Categorical Variables:**
    * **Nominal:** Categories that have no inherent order or ranking. Example: Gender (male, female), State (New Jersey, New York, etc.).
    * **Ordinal:** Categories that have an inherent order or ranking. Example: Education (Bachelors, Masters, PhD), Salary (low, medium, high).

* **Encoding Types:**
    * **Nominal Encoding:** Used for nominal categorical variables.
    * **Ordinal Encoding:** Used for ordinal categorical variables.

**Nominal Encoding:**

* **One-Hot Encoding:**
    * Creates a new column for each category.
    * Values in the new columns are 1 for the category and 0 for all other categories.
    * Example: Gender (male, female) becomes two columns: Gender_Male and Gender_Female.
* **One-Hot Encoding with Many Categories:**
    * If there are many categories, one-hot encoding can create a large number of columns.
    * A solution is to only create columns for the top N most frequent categories.
* **Mean Encoding:**
    * Calculates the mean of the target variable for each category.
    * Replaces the categorical values with the corresponding mean values.
    * Example: State (New Jersey, New York, etc.) becomes the mean salary for each state.

**Ordinal Encoding:**

* **Label Encoding:**
    * Assigns a numerical value to each category.
    * The values are typically assigned in ascending order of the category's rank.
    * Example: Education (Bachelors, Masters, PhD) becomes 1, 2, 3.
* **Target Guided Ordinal Encoding:**
    * Similar to label encoding, but the numerical values are assigned based on the mean of the target variable for each category.
    * Example: Education (Bachelors, Masters, PhD) becomes the mean salary for each degree type.

**Advantages and Disadvantages:**

* **One-Hot Encoding:**
    * **Advantages:**
        * Easy to understand and implement.
        * Preserves the original categories.
    * **Disadvantages:**
        * Can create a large number of columns if there are many categories.
        * Can lead to overfitting if there are too many categories.
* **Mean Encoding:**
    * **Advantages:**
        * Reduces the number of columns created compared to one-hot encoding.
        * Can help to improve model performance by capturing the relationship between the categorical variable and the target variable.
    * **Disadvantages:**
        * Can be more difficult to understand and interpret than one-hot encoding.
        * Can be sensitive to outliers in the target variable.
* **Label Encoding:**
    * **Advantages:**
        * Easy to understand and implement.
        * Reduces the number of columns created compared to one-hot encoding.
    * **Disadvantages:**
        * Can lose the original order of the categories.
        * Can lead to overfitting if the categories are not evenly distributed.

**Conclusion:**

* The choice of encoding technique depends on the specific problem and the type of categorical variable.
* It is important to consider the advantages and disadvantages of each technique before making a decision.
* Experimenting with different encoding techniques is often the best way to find the one that works best for a particular problem.
